# ProjectWeb


Here is a basic dynamic website to mimic a well organized interactive blog. User's can reach out and interact with different elements of the website. 
This website is also plant themed, I do love plants and quarantine seemed to exacerbate that! 
With basic html layout and CSS styling features to make it more user friendly and navigable. There are pictures of my favorite plants (at the time), check it out!
